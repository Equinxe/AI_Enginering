#!/usr/bin/env bash
# IA Engineering — behaviour tests for the portable check scripts.
#
# WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR
#
# The checks under Adapters/scripts/check-*.sh used to be shell embedded in a
# CI workflow file, where the only way to exercise them was to push a branch
# and read a log. That is how a defect survived in the `pr-size` check until it
# deadlocked a release: it refused every Pull Request whose diff listed no
# files, which is right when the refs are wrong and wrong for a back-merge, and
# telling those apart required constructing a back-merge in production.
#
# Every case here builds a REAL git repository and runs the REAL script against
# it. Nothing is mocked and nothing is reimplemented: if a case passes, the
# shipped script did the thing.
#
# ADD A CASE FOR EVERY DEFECT. A check that was wrong once and is now right,
# with no case pinning it, is a check that will be wrong again the next time
# someone edits it.
#
# USAGE
#
#   Adapters/scripts/tests/run.sh [--verbose]
#
# Exit 0 when every case passes, 1 otherwise. Prints the denominator, because
# a suite that reports "all passed" without saying how many is not evidence
# (Adapters/README.md, The Check Convention, rule 3).
